    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" style="margin-bottom:5px">V4</h3><br>
      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Aim</strong></p>
      <p class="govuk-body">V4 looked at how a campaign might use a pre-sift (otherwise known as an 'initial sift') and how we could capture it's requirements in the 'create a vacancy' journey. Our aim was to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>give an option to allow a pre-sift if necessary</li>
        <li>capture what and how the pre-sift should be</li>
        <li>capture what should happen to successful pre-sifted applications</li>
        <li>show the pre-sift info replicated in the actual job ad</li>
        <li>show the new pre-sift tasks created when managing the vacancy</li>
      </ul><br>

      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>What we did</strong></p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We added a pre-sift option to the existing <a href="https://csjobs-hiring-side-a6b074da6857.herokuapp.com/csu71/task-list-new-campaign-initial-sift" target="_blank">'create a vacancy' journey</a>, accessed by clicking on 'Select assessment methods for sift'. We also added an  <a href="https://csjobs-hiring-side-a6b074da6857.herokuapp.com/vacancy-management-dashboard/strategy-admin-tasklist-presift" target="_blank">updated task list</a> where new pre-sift tasks could be seen (although they didn't function and weren't tested). Lastly, we added <a href="https://csjobs-hiring-side-a6b074da6857.herokuapp.com/vacancy-management-dashboard/job-ad#process" target="_blank">a relevant version of the job ad</a> so the user could see a pre-sift message within the application process section.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" style="margin-bottom:5px">V3</h3><br>
      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Aim</strong></p>
      <p class="govuk-body">V3 stepped away from the 'create a vacancy' process and moved onto setting up multiple sift panels during bulk campaigns. Our aim was to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>demo a vacancy management dashboard, where a user could see vacancies, manage vacancy users, read guidance etc</li>
        <li>allow a user to get messages / warnings related to bulk campaign activity</li>
        <li>allow a user to set up both a single and multiple sift panels, including allocating roles to members of the panel</li>
      </ul><br>

      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>What we did</strong></p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We created a new prototype for a <a href="https://csjobs-hiring-side-a6b074da6857.herokuapp.com/vacancy-management-dashboard/campaigns" target="_blank">vacancy management dashboard</a>, which would lead the user onto an <a href="https://csjobs-hiring-side-a6b074da6857.herokuapp.com/vacancy-management-dashboard/strategy-admin-tasklist" target="_blank">updated task list</a> where new sift panels could be added.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" style="margin-bottom:5px" id="bulkv2">V2</h3><br>
      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Aim</strong></p>
      <p class="govuk-body">V2 was an iteration of the initial V1 prototype. Based on adding multi-grade / contract functionality and some improvements based on user feedback from V1, our aim was to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>allow a user to build a single ad with multiple job types e.g. different grades or contract types</li>
        <li>increase contact options by offering a 'team mailbox' option</li>
        <li>amending content where issues had been raised during V1 testing</li>
      </ul><br>

      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>What we did</strong></p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We made the above changes to create a <a href="https://csjobs-hiring-side-a6b074da6857.herokuapp.com/csu71/task-list-new-campaign" target="_blank">V2 version of 'create a vacancy'</a>.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>What we did</strong></p>

          <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Aim</strong></p>
          <p class="govuk-body">This was the next iteration of the advert-only user journey to set up a vacancy on CS Jobs, following feedback from V1 research. Our aim was to:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>test 3 versions of advert setup: version A, with no assessment criteria / version B, with a short tasklist and condensed pages / version C, designed as a 'build your ad' single page where all data was entered on one page in the style of the actual job ad</li>
            <li>give a more realistic JAO assessment of a finalised ad, with recommendations</li>
            <li>allow a user to see how JAO recommendations could be fixed online</li>

          </ul><br>

          <p class="govuk-body"><strong>What we did</strong></p>
          <p class="govuk-body">We produced three versions of prototypes to allow a user to set up an advert-only vacancy (although it should be stressed that version C was poorly formed due to lack of time and did not have the required design / functionality we wanted to test).<br><br>We also created a dummy JAO output process, and a prototype to allow the user to view and fix output from the JAO.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Aim</strong></p>
          <p class="govuk-body">This was our first prototyping of the advert-only user journey to set up a vacancy on CS Jobs. Our aim was to:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>see whether the full service journey could simply be cut down to suit advert-only campaigns</li>
            <li>find out if parsing an existing ad into CS Jobs would be useful to the user</li>
            <li>capture whether users understood about CS Commission Recruitment Principles</li>
            <li>see if a progress bar was useful</li>
            <li>see whether setting up selection criteria and assessment methods would be an advantage here</li>
          </ul><br>

          <p class="govuk-body"><strong>What we did</strong></p>
          <p class="govuk-body">We analysed each page in the <a href="https://csjobs-hiring-side-a6b074da6857.herokuapp.com/csu71/task-list-new-campaign-initial-sift" target="_blank">'create a vacancy' journey</a>, and removed the pages we felt were not needed for advert-only users. The remaining prototype was then tested with advert-only users, having also had some extra facilities added: a progress bar on the main tasklist page, the ability to parse in an existing ad and a page dealing with the Commission recruitment principles.</p>
